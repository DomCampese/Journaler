# Journaler
[Journaler](https://journaler.netlify.app) is a mental health tool that lets a user create and edit journal entries to track their mood, reflect on their day, or vent about their troubles. It is built with a React frontend and a Django backend REST API using JWT Authentication. This repository only contains the frontend source code leveraging the create-react-app layout.
